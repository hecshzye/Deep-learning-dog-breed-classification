**Dog breed classification using Deep Learning**

  - An end to end dog breed classification deep learning model using **TensorFlow(Imagenet (ILSVRC-2012-CLS) classification with MobileNet V2 (depth multiplier 1.30))**. 

  **Multi-class Dog Breed Classification** üêï üê∂

   - Building an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

  **Goal**

   - Identifying the breed of a dog with an image of dog.

  **Data**

   - The data used in this project is from Dog Breed Identification Competition by Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

  **Evaluation**
   - The evaluation file consists of the prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation

  **Features**
  
   - Unstructured data using deep Learning/transfer learning.
   - Using 120 different breeds of dogs (120 classes)
   - Using 10,000+ images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set.
